PURPOSE:
    Defines the ImageForm for uploading the main mosaic source image and configuring mosaic options.

DETAILS:
    - Lets the user upload a file, select shape and quality, set artistic/fading effects, and name the output file.
    - Used by `views.py` to render and process the main upload form.

MODERNIZATION NOTES:
    - Fully Python 3/Django 3+ compatible.
    - You can further enhance with help_text, custom validation, or widgets.
